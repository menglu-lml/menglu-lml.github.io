I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Electrical, Computer, and Biomedical Engineering](https://www.torontomu.ca/engineering-architectural-science/programs/graduate-programs/electrical-computer-engineering-graduate-programs/) at Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University), Toronto, ON, Canada, under the supervision of [Prof. Xiao-Ping (Steven) Zhang](https://sites.google.com/view/xiaopingzhang/home?authuser=0) and [Prof. Lian Zhao](https://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~lzhao/). I received my B.A.Sc. at the University of Toronto and my M.Eng. at Toronto Metropolitan University in 2019 and 2021, respectively.

My research focuses on deep learning and audio processing, with a specialization in **speech deepfake detection** and **audio signal analysis**. My work has been presented at renowned venues, including Interspeech and WASPAA, and I was awarded the Ontario Graduate Scholarship in recognition of my research contributions. I currently serve as Secretary of the IEEE Toronto ComSoc chapter.
